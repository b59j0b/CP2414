This assignment has been divided into two   (2) parts:
Part   I   -   Identify   and   analyse   threats to   a   company. Also, research   and   source   appropriate   devices/software   justifying   choices   (feasibility, efficiency, etc.).
Part II - Design   a   secured network.
Part III – Citation and Referencing.
Deliverables: 
1.       A single Word document (.docx) – containing   all parts.
2.       Font - Calibri   11,   Line   Spacing   1.5
3.       Use   IEEE   referencing, see https://libguides.jcu.edu.au/IEEE 
NOTE: The assignment template can be found at the end   of   this   assignment   sheets.
Scenario: 
An Australian mattress in a box company, TheSleepyheads, has grown concerned   by the global   rise in cybercrime and ransomware.
They have asked you   to:
•         For all branches - Identify and analyse application and networking-based threats to their   company;   and
•         For   the Perth branch only -   recommend   preventative   and   mitigative   technologies   and   strategies for potential intrusion and attacks   on the network.
About the company: TheSleepyheads is a growing mattress in a   box company consisting of   two branches: The Perth   (main)   branch   and   the   Melbourne   branch.   Each   branch   has   four   departments   and   there   are   approximately   40   employees   per   department.   The   Perth   branch   has 1 mail    server,   2   web   servers, and 2 database   servers. The   Melbourne branche   is   a   smaller   branch   and   so   it   has   only   1 mail server and   1   database   server.
All branches have high-speed networks; however, the traffic can be quite heavy on weekdays.   This is especially true   for the   Perth branch.
PartI. Potential Threats 
You   have been provided   with   a   list   of complaints   from   employees   about   the workstations   at TheSleepyheads:
• Complaint 1 (Teddy): My   computer   takes   a   long   longtime   to   startup   and   shut   down.   It   seems   like   there   are   other   programs   which   I   don’t   use   running   when   I   start   my   computer as   well.
• Complaint 2 (Christina): I   often   get   the blue   screen   of death,   my workstation keeps   crashing. I found it to be   so   frustrating.
• Complaint 3 (Meredith): It takes forever to download a file from the company servers.   It doesn’t even matter what the size or   type   of   the   file   are.
• Complaint 4 (Alex): I’ve   got   customers   and   colleagues   informing   me   that   I’ve   been   sending them emails, this is very weird because my   job doesn’t really concern   sending   out emails to my colleagues, let   alone   customers.
• Complaint 5 (Richard): I get   a   lot   of   pop-ups   on   my   screen;   I   have never   visited   any   bad (inappropriate) websites.
• Complaint 6 (Joe)代 写CP2414 Assignment 1 Security checklistWeb
代做程序编程语言: The   fan   in   my   computer   is just   so   loud.   It   seems   to   be   spinning   really fast and all the time. Even   when   I   am not using   it.
• Complain 7 (All employees): Difficulty   accessing   the   website,   mail   and   database   servers.From   the   complaints   above, you   are   required   to   analyse   and   identify   the   threat/s   (if   there   are   any). You must also make a recommendation on strategies and technologies (i.e. hardware and   software) to prevent and mitigate the problems.
IMPORTANT NOTE: 
1. Your   threat   analysis   and   identification   should ONLY concern   network   security   and NOT hardware or software.
2. It is possible that the complaints are connected to   one   another.
Part II. Firewall, Honeypot/s, and Other Network Security Technologies Planning and Design for Perth Branch Employing   firewalls, honeypots,   and   other network   security   technologies   can be   an   effective   means   of protecting   the   company   networks.   As   such,   you   are   required   to   design   a   network   security   configuration   for   the   Perth   branch   of   the   company.   To   do   this,   you   will   need   to   consider the existing devices (see      “About    the company”    –      Perth branch ONLY),      the   hardware/software   solutions   you   recommended   in   PartI, and   additional   honeypot/s.
You are required to:
1.       Draw your proposed secure   network diagram, including:
a.         Firewall/s
b.       Other Network Security Technologies   (hardware and/or software)
c.         Honeypot/s
d.       Existing devices (e.g. servers, workstations, router,   switches)
2.       Explain and   justify the configuration diagram with respect to:
a.       The type   and placement of   each   firewall;
b.       The honeypot location/s and   quantity;
c.       The   placement   and   purpose   of   each   piece   of   hardware/software.
Part III. Use   correct   IEEE   referencing   style, see https://libguides.jcu.edu.au/IEEE. 
Suggested Report Structure/Template 
For the highest marks possible, you should READ THE RUBRIC and   submit   your report   using the following proposed structure:
PartI. Potential Threats 
For each employee   complaint:
Complaint   [number] –   [name]:
•         Identify the problem/s stated by the employee/s.
•          [Identified threat/s] –   [Discussion and comprehensive explanation for the   identified threat/s]
•          Solution –   [Recommended solution for threat]   Overarching Threat:
[If   an overarching threat exists you should discuss this here.   See   IMPORTANT NOTE]
Part II. Firewall/s, honeypot/s, and other network security technologies Planning and Design 
•         Diagram
•       Explanation   and   justification   of   the   proposed   configuration.
